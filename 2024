               This works acts as a translation of an area that historically and contemporary has many layers; the seashore. Eternally moving back and forth, 
the space between the water and the shore carries a diverse flora and fauna underground, in the sea and above the sand, while simultaneously dealing with a 
humanitarian crisis and changing vastly over the years with its rising eb.
In this textile piece I want to shed light on the seemingly endlessness of it, but with pauses in-between, promises of collective hope and action. <br>

            <p>Drive one – machine, refining and storing. Electricity sings. ‘Things break apart everyday anyhow – especially high technology – and end up as inert objects, dead media, discarded technology.’
Bursting spring chirping birds hovering above electrical cars. Fueling -
.. What was left was a pocket-sized device, with a system coated and coded.
The digital documentation of these past months will end up in The Netherlands. However, the objects being documented were in a sense already ghosts, but still with an ability to function if handled differently.

In our studio, lights, chargers and hot water are connected to power circuits. Noise coming from the factories are made by these circuits as well. I wonder what happens to electronical physical waste, as it has the ability to power up like a circuit.
When thinking about technology, it often comes to my mind that the technology I use and have used, will eventually scatter and depart to either another person, storage space or waste center. When that happens, the object is not in sight anymore. I have tried to create an exoskeleton for the waste, to highlight its past potential.
